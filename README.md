# Algorithm

An algorithm is step-by-step procedure, that defines how to approach a problem to get a particular solution.
Algorithms are designed to obtain optimum solution for any given problem.
Mainly there are three type of approach for developing an algorithm:

- Greedy Approach
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming

#### Greedy Approach
***
Greedy approach tries to achieve the solution based on the decision made from the given solution domain.
The solution closest to the optimum solution is selected.

#### Divide and Conquer
***
It is hard to solve a huge problem on its own, thus we divide that big problem into smaller sub problems which can be solved independently.
We keep on dividing the problem into sub problems until the problem is atomic. 
Then we solve these atomic sub problems and finally all the solutions are merged to obtain the solution of the original problem.

#### Dynamic Programming
***
Dynamic programming is similar to divide and conquer technique. 
It also divides the problem into smaller sub problems.
But unlike divide and conquer it doesn't solve them independently. 
The solutions are stored and are used for the same type of problem again.
